2024-08-07: An email was sent to Agnes Mancini and Catherine Hart on 2024-08-01 inquiring if they want to resurrect this project (i.e., greens and hawksbill turtle CMR analyses). Their responses were positive.

Catherine: 
"Thanks for touching base on this...time really flies!

"I moved to the UK 3 months ago (position at Bristol Zoological Society) but I am interested in keeping my turtle related research going so, if Agnese is happy with it, I would definitely be interested in picking these two studies up again."

Agnes:

"I am super interested in getting the East pacific green turtle study out ASAP, however for the hawksbill dataset, there is a study on going with ICAPO, I think it is a population viability study, so I am double checking that we would not repeat/duplicate efforts and will let you know! 

"Tomo, should we update the database? So many more Cm :) would be interesting adding them, i think!

"Happy to get this running again, I will be travelling a lot in the next couple of months, but will do my best to reply as fast as possible!"

I sent her the last dataset and she will update the spreadsheet in the near future and we will pick it up again. 

Because some sites do not have sufficient recaptures to fit some of the models, I should look into one place at a time to analyze the site-specific data in details. I will return to this when I received the updated dataset from Agnes.

New data file was received on 2024-09-26

## Methods {-}

(I think a lot of this stuff can be in appendix. We can just provide results for a couple places.)

To estimate survival rate and abundance of green turtles, Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) models were fitted to the capture-recapture dataset for green turtles. Results indicated that apparent changes in abundance might have been caused by sampling inequalities among study sites. In order to remove the inequalities, CJS models were fitted to data from each study site independently. This was justified by the lack of movements by turtles among the study sites. 

Briefly, the CJS model uses the capture history of each individual without assuming that the population is closed. There are two main parameters in the basic model; survival rate (Phi) and capture/recapture probability (p).  The abundance may be estimated through the Horvitz-Thompson estimator, where the number of captured individuals per sampling period is divided by the estimated capture probability for that time period. The estimated survival rate should be considered as an apparent survival rate as the permanent emigrant is considered as dead.  Effects of transients, however, can be determined.   

The basic model can be extended to accommodate various modifications, such as time-dependent survival rates, time-dependent capture probability, covariate-dependent survival rates and capture probabilities.

Communities with small proportions (< 0.05) of recaptures, i.e., the number of individuals caught more than once in the total number of individuals, were excluded from the analysis because of insufficient numbers of recaptures. 

Capture history data from each study area with sufficient numbers of recaptures were pooled by sampling seasons (summer and winter). In other words, multiple captures within each season were treated as one capture. 

I considered several possible CJS models for this analysis. For survival rates, they were treated as either constant or affected by transients (time-since-marking; tsm). For capture probabilities, they were treated as either constant, time dependent, different between the first and subsequent captures (trap response), different between summer and winter, or a function of effort. A total of 14 models were fitted to the data (Table \@ref(tab:model-defs)).

Capture-recapture data of green turtles were separated into study areas and CJS models were fitted using Mark (White and Cooch Yr) via RMark (v. `r packageVersion("RMark")`, Laake 2013, Laake, J.L. (2013). RMark: An R Interface for Analysis of Capture-Recapture Data with MARK. AFSC Processed Rep 2013-01, 25p. Alaska Fish. Sci. Cent., NOAA, Natl. Mar. Fish. Serv., 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle WA 98115.). Some capture events in the beginning of a few time series were deleted because of the small numbers of captures. For each location, fit of various models were compared using AICc. Parameters estimates from the model with the smallest AICc value are reported. We used UCare through R2ucare (v. `r packageVersion("R2ucare")`, Olivier Gimenez, Jean-Dominique Lebreton, Remi Choquet and Roger Pradel (2017). R2ucare: Goodness-of-Fit Tests for Capture-Recapture Models. R package version 1.0.0. https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R2ucare) to test for goodness-of-fit. 

The best models for each location were also fitted using the Bayesian equivalent (Kery an Schaub 2012; Bayesian population analysis using WinBUGS. Academic Press, Elsevier, Waltham MA, USA) using JAGS (v. 4.3.0, Plummer 2017) via the jagsUI package (v. `r packageVersion("jagsUI")`, Kellner 2019, Ken Kellner (2019). jagsUI: A Wrapper Around 'rjags' to Streamline 'JAGS' Analyses. R package version 1.5.1. https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=jagsUI) in R (`r paste0(R.Version()$major, ".", R.Version()$minor)`, R Core Team). To obtain the joint posterior distribution of parameters through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), we ran 5 chains of 50,000 steps where the first 30,000 samples were discarded as burn-in samples. The remaining 20,000 samples were thinned by taking every five sample. Posterior distributions were summarized using the resulting 20,000 samples (4,000 x 5 chains). Convergence of MCMC was determined using Gelman-Rubin statistics.  

Using the two different approaches to analyze the capture-recapture data allowed us to determine if reliable estimates were obtained for each dataset, especially with small numbers of recaptures. Although the model structures between the maximum-likelihood and Bayesian approaches are different, estimates should be similar if the data supported the models. We graphically show the correlation between estimates obtained from the two approaches. In the best case scenario, the estimates from the two approaches should fall on the y=x line with similar uncertainties. Large departures between the approaches indicate that estimates are likely not reliable.

## Results {-}
Of ```r length(site.names)``` communities, only ```r length(site.names.used)``` communities contained sufficient recaptures. Data for  ```r length(site.names) - length(site.names.used)```  communities were not used in the following analysis. Goodness of fit of CJS models was examined for each study area. Results from each site are provided separately in the following sections.

### Goodness of fit {-}

These results should be in a supplementary material.

}

                      FUN = function(x) out.list <- list(site  = x$site, 
                                                         Chi2 = x$test.out$chi2,

overall.GOF.df <- data.frame(do.call(rbind, overall.GOF))

```

#### Overall test {-}
The goodness of fit tests indicated that the models fit well to the data and no apparent overdispersion was found in all sites (c-hat < 1.2, Table \@ref(tab:table-overall-GOF)). 

```{r check_GNO_data, echo=F, include=F}
output.filename <- paste0("RData/CJS_Cm_2023_RMark_input_GNO.rds")
GNO_data <- readRDS(file = output.filename)
#CH.Ucare <-R2ucare::group_data(CJS.data$data, effX = rep(1, nrow(CJS.data$data)))
CH.Ucare <- GNO_data$CH.R2ucare
GNO_overall <- overall_CJS(as.matrix(CH.Ucare[, 1:(ncol(CH.Ucare)-1)]), 
                           freq = CH.Ucare$effY)



```


```{r table-overall-GOF, echo=F, include=T}
knitr::kable(overall.GOF.df, 
             digits = 2,
             col.names = c("site", "Chi2", "df", "p val", "c-hat"),
             caption = "Results from overall goodness-of fit",
             table.attr = "style='width:30%;'")

```

#### TEST3.SR {-}
A test to determine if there is a difference in apparent survival among individuals (TEST3.SR) indicated that there was no observed differences (Table \@ref(tab:table-test3sr)). This test is based on calculating the proportion of captured individuals on a capture date that was recaptured in later dates. 

```{r test3sr, echo=FALSE, include=T}
test3sr.overall <- lapply(test3sr_Cm, 
                         FUN = function(x){out.list <- list(site  = x$site, 
                                                            stat = unname(x$test.out$test3sr["stat"]),
                                                            df = unname(x$test.out$test3sr["df"]),
                                                            p_val = unname(x$test.out$test3sr["p_val"]),
                                                            sign_test = unname(x$test.out$test3sr["sign_test"]))
                         return(out.list)})

test3sr.overall.df <- data.frame(do.call(rbind, test3sr.overall))
```


```{r table-test3sr, echo=F, include=T}
knitr::kable(test3sr.overall.df, 
             digits = 2,
             col.names = c("site", "Stat", "df", "p val", "signed test"),
             caption = "Results from Test3.sr, which evaluates difference in the expected time of first recapture between the ‘new’ and ‘old’ individuals captured at occasion i and seen again at least once",
             table.attr = "style='width:30%;'")

```

#### TES3.Sm {-}

TEST3.Sm tests the hypothesis that there is no difference in the expected time of first recapture between the ‘new’ and ‘old’ individuals captured at occasion i and seen again at least once. It looks at individuals who were seen again. "Among these individuals seen again, when they were seen again does not depend on whether or not they were seen for the first time at occasion (i)."

```{r test3.sm, echo=F, include=F, cache=T}
test3sm.overall <- lapply(test3sm_Cm, 
                          FUN = function(x) out.list <- list(site  = x$site, 
                                                             stat =  unname(x$test.out$test3sm["stat"]),
                                                             df =  unname(x$test.out$test3sm["df"]),
                                                             p_val = unname(x$test.out$test3sm["p_val"])))


test3sm.overall.df <- data.frame(do.call(rbind, test3sm.overall))
```

All datasets passed test3.sm (Table \@ref(tab:table-test3sm)).

```{r table-test3sm, echo=F, include=T}
knitr::kable(test3sm.overall.df, 
             digits = 2,
             col.names = c("site", "Stat", "df", "p val"),
             caption = "Results from Test3.sm, which evaluates difference in the expected time of first recapture between the ‘new’ and ‘old’ individuals captured at occasion i and seen again at least once",
             table.attr = "style='width:30%;'")
```

#### TEST2.CT {-}

TEST2.CT tests the hypothesis that "there is no difference in the probability of being recaptured at t+1 between those captured and not captured at occasion t, conditional on presence at both occasions.  

```{r test2ct, echo=F, include=F}
test2ct.overall <- lapply(test2ct_Cm, 
                          FUN = function(x) out.list <- list(site  = x$site, 
                                                             stat =  unname(x$test.out$test2ct["stat"]),
                                                             df =  unname(x$test.out$test2ct["df"]),
                                                             p_val = unname(x$test.out$test2ct["p_val"]),
                                                             sign_test = unname(x$test.out$test2ct["sign_test"])))


test2ct.overall.df <- data.frame(do.call(rbind, test2ct.overall))
```

All datasets, except PAO, passed test2.ct (Table \@ref(tab:table-test2ct)).

```{r table-test2ct, echo=F, include=T}
knitr::kable(test2ct.overall.df, 
             digits = 2,
             col.names = c("site", "stat", "df", 
                           "p val", "signed test"),
             caption = "Results from Test2.ct, which evaluates difference in the probability of being recaptured at t+1 between those captured and not captured at occasion t, conditional on presence at both occasions",
             table.attr = "style='width:30%;'")
```

#### TEST2.CL {-}

TEST2.CL tests if there is no difference in the expected time of next capture between the individuals captured and not captured at occasion t conditional on presence at both occasions t and t + 2.  

```{r test2cl, echo=F, include=F, warning=F}
# The null hypothesis being tested in TEST2.CL is that there is no difference in
# the expected time of next recapture between the individuals captured and not captured at occasion i
# conditional on presence at both occasions i and i+2. To date, this test has no ‘simple’ interpretation, but
#it is a component test of the overall TEST2 fit statistic.
test2cl.overall <- lapply(test2cl_Cm, 
                          FUN = function(x) out.list <- list(site  = x$site, 
                                                             stat =  unname(x$test.out$test2cl["stat"]),
                                                             df =  unname(x$test.out$test2cl["df"]),
                                                             p_val = unname(x$test.out$test2cl["p_val"])))


test2cl.overall.df <- data.frame(do.call(rbind, test2cl.overall))
```

All datasets, except BKS, passed test2.cl (Table \@ref(tab:table-test2cl)).

```{r table-test2cl, echo=F, include=T}
knitr::kable(test2cl.overall.df, 
             digits = 2,
             col.names = c("site", "Stat", "df", "p val"),
             caption = "Results from Test2.cl, which evaluates the expected time of next capture between the individuals captured and not captured at occasion t conditional on presence at both occasions t and t + 2",
             table.attr = "style='width:30%;'")

```

All tests indicate that almost all datasets passed the GOF tests. (except Test3.sr for GNO, which resulted in NAs... and PAO Test2.ct, which had p < 0.05). Possible reasons for these possible violations are discussed later.  

For the following analyses, estimated capture probabilities that were less than 0.001 were considered unreliable and eliminated. 


#### BKS summary statistics {-}

```{r capture_history_BKS, echo=FALSE}
loc <- "BKS"
dat.1.Cm.site <- filter(dat.1.Cm, Macro_site == loc)
Cm.inputs <- readRDS(file = paste0("RData/CJS_Cm_2023_RMark_input_", loc, ".rds"))

loc.stats <- capture.recapture.stats(loc, dat.1.Cm.site, save.fig,
                                     fig.height = fig.height, fig.width = fig.width)

CJS.data <- loc.stats$CJS.data
n.occ <- loc.stats$n.occ
n.caught <- loc.stats$n.caught
n.caps <- loc.stats$n.caps

```

At ```r loc```, there were ```r nrow(CJS.data$data)``` turtles in the dataset, which contained ```r ncol(CJS.data$data)``` capture occasions from ```r colnames(CJS.data$data)[1]``` to ```r colnames(CJS.data$data)[ncol(CJS.data$data)]```. However, the numbers of turtles caught per capture occasion before ```r Cm.inputs$first.sample.date``` were insufficient to be included in CMR analyses (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-recap-n-BKS)). Consequently, the capture histories of ```r nrow(Cm.inputs$CH.1)``` individual turtles from ```r Cm.inputs$first.sample.date``` to ```r max(dat.1.Cm.site$DATE)``` were used in the analysis (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-Cap-His-BKS). 


```{r plot-recap-n-BKS, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.cap="The number of recaptures of green turtles at each capture occasion at BKS. "}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0("figures/Cm_recaptures_", loc, ".png"))
```

There were ```r ncol(Cm.inputs$CJS.data$data)``` capture occasions and the number of captured turtles per capture occasion ranged from ```r min(n.caught, na.rm = T)``` to ```r max(n.caught, na.rm = T)``` (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-recap-n-BKS). The number of captures per individual ranged from ```r min(rowSums(CJS.data$data))``` to ```r max(rowSums(CJS.data$data))``` with the median of ```r median(rowSums(CJS.data$data))``` and the mean of ```r signif(mean(rowSums(CJS.data$data)), 2)``` (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-Cap-n-BKS). 


```{r plot-Cap-His-BKS, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.cap="Figure. Capture histories of tagged green turtles at BKS. Each filled circle indicates a capture event and the same individuals are connected by lines."}

##### Mark (Phi[.]p[t]) {-}
For this study area, the best model was a constant survival and time-dependent capture probabilities (Phi[~1]p[time], \@ref(tab:table-model-BKS)). The second best model with $\delta$AICc = 1.45 (Phi[tsm]p[time]) indicated survival may be a function of time-since-marking, which is an evidence of presence of transient animals.

Using the best model, the survival rate was estimated to be ```r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[1,"estimate"], 3)``` (SE = ```r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[1, "se"], 3)```, 95% CI = [```r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[1, "lcl"], 2)``` - ```r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[1, "ucl"], 2)```]). The wide confidence interval indicated that this estimate is not very reliable. 

Estimated mean seasonal abundance fluctuated over time, which ranged from ```r signif(min(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Nhats$Nhat, na.rm = T),2)``` to ```r format(signif(max(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Nhats$Nhat, na.rm = T), 5), big.mark = ",")``` with large uncertainty, which likely resulted from small numbers of recaptures (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-Nhats-BKS)).

Using the best model (```r BKS.models.df[1,] %>% select(model)```), the estimated mean survival rate was ```r signif(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Phihats$mean, 3)``` (SD = ```r signif(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Phihats$sd, 3)```, 95% CI = [```r signif(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Phihats$lcl, 3)``` - ```r signif(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Phihats$ucl, 2)```]). These estimates are less than those from Mark. I'm not sure what's happening here. They should be the same model. I looked for obvious errors, e.g., incorrect model files, model statements, etc. But, I did not find anything there. This needs to be investigated a bit more. 2021-08-16. 

I think the problem is the recapture rate is very small - the vast majority of turtles were caught just once. Does Mark drop those that were caught just once? It makes no sense to have such high survival rate if many were caught just once... 

Estimated mean seasonal abundance fluctuated over time, which ranged from ```r signif(min(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Nhats$mean, na.rm = T), 2)``` to ```r signif(max(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Nhats$mean, na.rm = T), 3)``` with large uncertainty (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-Nhats-jags-v5-BKS)), which likely resulted from small numbers of recaptures.

Using the best model, the survival rate of residents was estimated to be `r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[2,"estimate"], 3)` (SE = `r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[2, "se"], 3)`, 95% CI = [`r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[2, "lcl"], 2)` - `r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[2, "ucl"], 2)`]). 

The proportion of residents was estimated to be `r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[1,"estimate"]/N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[2,"estimate"], 3)`, using the two survival rates (one for transients and residents and another for residents only). 

Estimated seasonal abundance fluctuated over time, which ranged from `r signif(min(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Nhats$Nhat, na.rm = T),2)` to `r format(signif(max(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Nhats$Nhat, na.rm = T), 5), big.mark = ",")` (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-Nhats-BMA)).

Using the best model (`r models.MARK.old %>% filter(site == loc) %>% select(model)`), the estimated mean survival rate of residents was `r signif(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Gammahats[2, "mean"], 3)` (SD = `r signif(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Gammahats[2, "sd"], 3)`, 95% CI = [`r signif(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Gammahats[2, "lcl"], 2)` - `r signif(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Gammahats[2, "ucl"], 2)`]). These estimates are similar to those from the maximum likelihood estimates. 

The proportion of residents was estimated to be `r signif(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Gammahats[1,"mean"]/N.Phi.hats.Jags$Gammahats[2,"mean"], 3)`, using the two survival rates (one for transients and residents and another for residents only), which was higher than the estimate from the maximum likelihood approach (0.21). 

Estimated mean seasonal abundance fluctuated over time, which ranged from `r signif(min(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Nhats$mean, na.rm = T), 2)` to `r signif(max(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Nhats$mean, na.rm = T), 3)` (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-Nhats-jags-v5-BMA)).

At `r loc`, there were `r nrow(CJS.data$data)` turtles in the dataset. However, the numbers of turtles caught per capture occasion before `r Cm.inputs$first.sample.date` were insufficient to include in CMR analyses and excluded (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-recap-n-GNO)). Consequently, the capture histories of `r nrow(Cm.inputs$CH.1)` individual turtles from `r Cm.inputs$first.sample.date` to `r max(dat.1.Cm.site$DATE, na.rm = T)` were used in the analysis (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-Cap-His-GNO)).

Although Phi[tsm]p[t] was the best model (Table \@ref(tab:table-models-GNO)), the mean estimate of the survival rate of residents and transients was virtually 1.0 (mean = `r N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[1, "estimate"]`) and its confidence interval ranged from virtually 0 to 1.0 . The second best model was only `r signif(GNO.models.df[2, "DeltaAICc"], 2)` AICc units away from the best model. Consequently, we used the second best model (Phi[.]p[t]) to make inference.

Using the Phi[.]p[t] model, the survival rate was estimated to be `r signif(N.Phi.p.hats$Phihats[1,"estimate"], 3)` (SE = `r signif(N.Phi.p.hats$Phihats[1, "se"], 3)`, 95% CI = [`r signif(N.Phi.p.hats$Phihats[1, "lcl"], 2)` - `r signif(N.Phi.p.hats$Phihats[1, "ucl"], 2)`]). 

Estimated seasonal abundance fluctuated over time, which ranged from `r signif(min(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Nhats$Nhat, na.rm = T), 2)` to `r format(signif(max(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Nhats$Nhat, na.rm = T), 5), big.mark = ",")` with large uncertainty, which likely resulted from small numbers of recaptures (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-Nhats-GNO)).

At `r loc`, there were `r nrow(CJS.data$data)` turtles in the dataset. However, the numbers of turtles caught per capture occasion before `r Cm.inputs$first.sample.date` were insufficient to include in CMR analyses and excluded (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-recap-n-IES)). Consequently, the capture histories of `r nrow(Cm.inputs$CH.1)` individual turtles from `r Cm.inputs$first.sample.date` to `r max(dat.1.Cm.site$DATE)` were used in the analysis (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-Cap-His-IES)).

```

There were `r ncol(Cm.inputs$CJS.data$data)` capture occasions and the number of captured turtles per capture occasion ranged from `r min(n.caught, na.rm = T)` to `r max(n.caught, na.rm = T)`. The number of captures per individual ranged from `r min(rowSums(CJS.data$data))` to `r max(rowSums(CJS.data$data))` with the median of `r median(rowSums(CJS.data$data))` and the mean of `r signif(mean(rowSums(CJS.data$data)), 2)` (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-Cap-n-IES)).

Using the best model (Phi[tsm]p[t], Table \@ref(tab:table-models-IES)), the estimated mean survival rate of residents was `r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[2,"estimate"], 3)` (SE = `r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[2, "se"], 3)`, 95% CI = [`r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[2, "lcl"], 2)` - `r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[2, "ucl"], 2)`]). 

The proportion of residents was estimated to be `r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[1,"estimate"]/N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[2,"estimate"], 3)`, using the two survival rates (one for transients and residents and another for residents only). 

Estimated seasonal abundance fluctuated over time, which ranged from `r signif(min(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Nhats$Nhat, na.rm = T),2)` to `r signif(max(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Nhats$Nhat, na.rm = T), 2)` with large uncertainty, which likely resulted from small numbers of recaptures (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-Nhats-IES)).

```

Using the best model (`r models.MARK.old %>% filter(site == loc) %>% select(model)`), the estimated mean survival rate of residents was `r signif(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Gammahats[2, "mean"], 3)` (SD = `r signif(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Gammahats[2, "sd"], 3)`, 95% CI = [`r signif(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Gammahats[2, "lcl"], 3)` - `r signif(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Gammahats[2, "ucl"], 2)`]), these estimates are similar to that from the ML approach (`r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[2,"estimate"], 3)`).

The proportion of residents was estimated to be `r signif(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Gammahats[1, "mean"]/N.Phi.hats.Jags$Gammahats[2,"mean"], 3)`, which were less than that from the ML approach.  

Estimated mean seasonal abundance fluctuated over time, which ranged from `r signif(min(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Nhats$mean, na.rm = T), 2)` to `r signif(max(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Nhats$mean, na.rm = T), 3)` with large uncertainty, which likely resulted from small numbers of recaptures (Figure \@ref(plot-Nhats-jags-v5-IES)). These estimates were significantly lower than those from MARK (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-Nhats-comparison-IES)). Abundance estimates from the two approaches were quite different, where MLEs were generally greater (by 10x) than Bayesian estimates. I don't have confidence in these estimates.

These estimates were significantly lower than those from MARK (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-Nhats-comparison-LSI)).

At `r loc`, there were `r nrow(CJS.data$data)` turtles in the dataset. However, the numbers of turtles caught per capture occasion before `r Cm.inputs$first.sample.date` were insufficient to include in CMR analyses and excluded (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-recap-n-MUL)). Consequently, the capture histories of `r nrow(Cm.inputs$CH.1)` individual turtles from `r Cm.inputs$first.sample.date` to `r max(dat.1.Cm.site$DATE)` were used in the analysis (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-Cap-His-MUL)).

There aren't many recaptures for this site.

MUL.models.df <- model.table(Cm.results.Mark)%>% select(model, DeltaAICc) %>% 
  mutate(model = paren2bracket(model)) #%>%tilde12dot()
```

Because of the few recaptures, I don't think it's meaningful to fit CMR models to these data... The model selection process shows that a lot of models were fit equally (\@ref(tab:table-models-MUL)). 


```{r table-models-MUL, echo=F, include=T}
knitr::kable(MUL.models.df,

plot.Nhats.Mark(loc, N.Phi.p.hats.Mark, save.fig, fig.height, fig.width)

```


Using the best model, the survival rate was estimated to be `r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[1,"estimate"], 3)` (SE = `r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[1, "se"], 3)`, 95% CI = [`r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[1, "lcl"], 2)` - `r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[1, "ucl"], 2)`]). 

Estimated seasonal abundance fluctuated over time, which ranged from `r signif(min(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Nhats$Nhat, na.rm = T),2)` to `r signif(max(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Nhats$Nhat, na.rm = T), 2)` with large uncertainty, which likely resulted from small numbers of recaptures (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-Nhats-MUL)).

I think these estimates are not very useful... given the few recaptures.

Using the best model (`r models.MARK.old %>% filter(site == loc) %>% select(model)`), the estimated survival rate was `r signif(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Phihats$mean, 3)` (mean, SD = `r signif(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Phihats$sd, 3)`, 95% CI = [`r signif(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Phihats$lcl, 3)` - `r signif(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Phihats$ucl, 3)`]).

The comparison between estimates from Mark and Jags were not exactly horrible (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-Nhats-comparison-MUL)). They are pretty close to each other albeit large uncertainties.

The number of captures per individual ranged from `r min(rowSums(CJS.data$data))` to `r max(rowSums(CJS.data$data))` with the median of `r median(rowSums(CJS.data$data))` and the mean of `r signif(mean(rowSums(CJS.data$data)), 2)` (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-Cap-n-PAO)).

##### Mark {-}

Cm.results.Mark <- readRDS(file = paste0("RData/CJS_Cm_RMark_", loc, ".rds"))

PAO.models.df <- model.table(Cm.results.Mark) %>%

             digits = 2,

             row.names = F,

```


```{r parameter_estimates_PAO, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

real.estimates <- Cm.results.Mark$Phi.dot.p.t$results$real %>% rownames_to_column("parameter")

N.Phi.p.hats.Mark <- extract.Nhats(Cm.inputs, Cm.results.Mark, real.estimates)

# turn Nhats to NA when SE = 0 or SE > 1000
#Nhats.df[Nhats.df$SE_Nhat < 0.001 | Nhats.df$SE_Nhat > 5000, c("Nhat", "lcl", "ucl", "lcl2")] <- NA
plot.Nhats.Mark(loc, N.Phi.p.hats.Mark, save.fig, fig.height, fig.width)

```


Using the best model (Table \@ref(tab:table-models-PAO)), the survival rate was estimated to be `r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[1,"estimate"], 3)` (SE = `r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[1, "se"], 3)`, 95% CI = [`r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[1, "lcl"], 2)` - `r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[1, "ucl"], 2)`]). 

Estimated seasonal abundance fluctuated over time, which ranged from `r signif(min(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Nhats$Nhat, na.rm = T),2)` to `r format(signif(max(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Nhats$Nhat, na.rm = T), 5), big.mark = ",")` with large uncertainty, which likely resulted from small numbers of recaptures (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-Nhats-PAO)).

##### Bayesian {-}

```{r parameter_estimates_jags_v5_PAO, echo=F, include=F}
# v5 means the same data and model as what Mark selected
#loc <- "PAO"
N.Phi.hats.Jags <- stats.Bayesian_v5(models.MARK.old, loc)

plot.Nhats.Jags(loc, N.Phi.hats.Jags, save.fig, fig.height, fig.width, ext = "jags_v5.png")

#format(signif(max(N.Phi.hats$Nhats$mean, na.rm = T), 5), big.mark = ",")
```

Using the best model (`r models.MARK.old %>% filter(site == loc) %>% select(model)`), the estimated mean survival rate was `r signif(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Phihats$mean, 3)` (SD = `r signif(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Phihats$sd, 3)`, 95% CI = [`r signif(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Phihats$lcl, 3)` - `r signif(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Phihats$ucl, 3)`]).

Estimated mean seasonal abundance fluctuated over time, which ranged from `r signif(min(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Nhats$mean, na.rm = T), 2)` to `r format(signif(max(N.Phi.hats.Jags$Nhats$mean, na.rm = T), 3), big.mark = ",")` with large uncertainty, which likely resulted from small numbers of recaptures (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-Nhats-jags-v5-PAO)). 

The comparison between estimates from Mark and Jags indicated they were quite different (Mark's estimates were greater than those from Jags, Figure \@ref(fig:plot-Nhats-comparison-PAO)). I would not use these estimates. The x axis goes to >45000 because Jags estimated abundance for some capture occasions that were not estimated by Mark. I think these estimates are not very useful.

At `r loc`, there were `r nrow(CJS.data$data)` turtles in the dataset. The entire dataset was used for the analysis, including capture histories of `r nrow(Cm.inputs$CH.1)` individual turtles from `r Cm.inputs$first.sample.date` to `r max(dat.1.Cm.site$DATE)` (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-Cap-His-PLM)).

Using the best model (Table \@ref(tab:table-models-PLM)), the survival rate was estimated to be `r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[2,"estimate"], 3)` (SE = `r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[2, "se"], 3)`, 95% CI = [`r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[2, "lcl"], 2)` - `r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[2, "ucl"], 2)`]). 

The proportion of residents was estimated to be `r signif(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[1,"estimate"]/N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Phihats[2,"estimate"], 3)`, using the two survival rates (one for transients and residents and another for residents only). 

Estimated seasonal abundance fluctuated over time, which ranged from `r signif(min(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Nhats$Nhat, na.rm = T),2)` to `r format(max(N.Phi.p.hats.Mark$Nhats$Nhat, na.rm = T), big.mark = ",")` with large uncertainty, which likely resulted from small numbers of recaptures (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-Nhats-PLM)).
