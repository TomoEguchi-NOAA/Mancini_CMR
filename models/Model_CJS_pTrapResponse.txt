# Cormack-Jolly-Seber model with trap response - p.212- on Kery and 
# Schaub Code is on p. 215. The way survival is incorporated into
# the likelihood has been modified from the original version. 
# in the book, it is in the first loop along with p[i,t]:
# phi[i,t] <- mean.phi.  This seems redundant so I changed 
# it to have just mean.phi in the state process. 

model {
  for (i in 1:nind){
     for (t in f[i] : (n.occasions-1)){
        p[i, t] <- beta[m[i,t]] 
     }
  }

  mean.phi ~ dbeta(5, 2) #dunif(0,1)

     beta[u] ~ dunif(0, 1)

    # define latent state at first capture
    z[i, f[i]] <- 1
    for (t in (f[i] + 1):n.occasions){

      z[i,t] ~ dbern(mu1[i,t])
